# Hugs

[Hugs](https://bjango.com/designresources/) is a super simple starting point for [Hugo](http://gohugo.io) websites.

Hugs is an entire, but mostly empty, Hugo project. Itâ€™s a good starting point, where the intention is to build a custom design. It contains no CSS, and only a tiny bit of HTML. However, it does include a fully set up folder structure, config.toml, partials, basic HTML templates, basic Markdown example posts, and scripts to build and run Hugoâ€™s server.

Hugs is what I use for all new website projects that I am building using Hugo.

### Help

1. [Install Hugo](http://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/), if you havenâ€™t done it already.
2. Download Hugs.
3. Unzip it, and copy the Hugs folder to where you want your new project (maybe rename the folder, too?).
4. Right click `hugo-build.command` and choose Open.
5. The project should build.

You can now edit `config.toml` and the contents to suit.
