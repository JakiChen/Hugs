# Hugs

[Hugs](https://bjango.com/designresources/) is a super simple starting point for [Hugo](http://gohugo.io) websites.

Hugs is an entire starting point for Hugo projects, where the intention is to build a custom design. It contains no CSS, and only a tiny bit of HTML. However, it does include a fully set up folder structure, config.toml, partials, basic HTML templates, basic Markdown example posts, and scripts to build and run Hugoâ€™s server.

Hugs is what I use for all new website projects that I am building using Hugo, and I thought others may benefit from a good starting point. It took me a while to parse all the Hugo documentation initially, and I think this would have helped me.
